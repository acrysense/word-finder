While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
							<h3>Advertisements</h3>
							<p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by TheWordSearch and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
							<h3>Links To External Sites</h3>
							<p>
								Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.

							<h3>thewordsearch.org uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h3>
							<p>
								https://thewordsearch.org/ uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry.

Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.

							<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
							<p>
								TheWordSearch discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on TheWordSearch's behalf or to provide services available at TheWordSearch's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using TheWordSearch's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. TheWordSearch will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, TheWordSearch discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when TheWordSearch believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of TheWordSearch, third parties or the public at large.
								<br>
								If you are a registered user of https://thewordsearch.org/ and have supplied your email address, TheWordSearch may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with TheWordSearch and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. TheWordSearch takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

							<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
							<p>
								Like most website operators, TheWordSearch collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TheWordSearch's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TheWordSearch's visitors use its website. From time to time, TheWordSearch may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
								<br>
								TheWordSearch also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://thewordsearch.org/ blog posts. TheWordSearch only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
